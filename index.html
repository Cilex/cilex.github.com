        <a href="https://github.com/Cilex/Cilex">Cilex</a> aims to provide a lightweight framework for creating PHP
        CLI scripts.
        It is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/fabpot/Silex">Silex</a> microframework for web
        applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like Silex, Cilex also ties together various <a href="https://github.com/symfony">Symfony2
        components</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/fabpot/pimple">Pimple Dependency Injection
        Container</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>For those wondering, "Cilex" is pronounced "C-lex", while "Silex" is pronounced "S-i-lex".</code></pre>
